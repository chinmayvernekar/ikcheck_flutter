Via iKCHECK you will receive an alert as soon as someone at an affiliated organization checks your identity or uses it for something. We believe that you have the right to know when that happens. That is why we dedicate ourselves day in day out to make this possible. Privacy, security and ease of use are essential for us.",
      "CONTENT2": "With iKCHECK you will be informed via alerts as soon as your personal data is used or viewed. Often this is because you use your identity somewhere. But it is also possible that there is identity theft. With iKCHECK you know what is happening and you can intervene if necessary. This way you keep control over your data.",
      "CONTENT3": "Affiliated organizations manage or use personal data. An example is the RDW, which issues driving licences. They will send you a notification via iKCHECK as soon as your data is used or viewed. You always decide for yourself which organizations will send you alerts about your personal data via iKCHECK. As soon as a new organization is available for you, you will receive a notification from us. We also regularly send you tips to protect you even better against (identity) fraud.",

      "CONTENT5": "If you receive an alert about your identity that you cannot explain, you indicate this in the app. You will then receive a fraud report. This allows you to point out the fraud to the organization where the fraud took place. In some cases it is wise to report the incident to the police.",
      "CONTENT6": "iKCHECK is a new type of service in the Netherlands, which has been developed in collaboration with government organizations. Connecting (public) partners is done very carefully and according to the highest standards. As soon as you receive a notification, something has happened to your identity. However, this does not always mean that it's fraud. Some organizations have this authority. It is also possible it takes some time between something that was started on your initiative and an alert.",
      "CONTENT7": "Your privacy is very important to us. iKCHECK only stores data that is necessary for receiving alerts. You can see us as a conduit for information that we believe you have the right to see. We limit the personal information in alerts to the minimum, so that only you can do something with it. Of course we never use your data for business without your permission.",
